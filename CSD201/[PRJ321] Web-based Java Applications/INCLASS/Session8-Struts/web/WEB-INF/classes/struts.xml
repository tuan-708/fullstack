<!--
    When declaring beans in this file you must either use name="struts" or don't name the bean at all.

    The name="struts" must be used when alias was defined in {@link org.apache.struts2.config.DefaultBeanSelectionProvider} -
    it is then the default bean's name and {@link org.apache.struts2.config.DefaultBeanSelectionProvider} links name "struts"
    with "default" (aliasing it)

    If name won't be defined then the "default" value will be used {@link com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.Container#DEFAULT_NAME}
    and {@link com.opensymphony.xwork2.inject.Inject}
